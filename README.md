This project involves the creation of a website that serves as a portfolio and is integrated with a SQL database to save messages from visitors who use the "Entrar em contato" form. The website's front-end has been built using Angular, while the back-end was developed with .NET 7 and utilizes minimal APIs to connect both components. Additionally, the back-end has been designed to work seamlessly with a SQL Server database.

> Update the appsettings.json - connectionString

> Update-database

> Build and run

### On web app

> Update Url from api on "src\app\services\contacts.service.ts"
